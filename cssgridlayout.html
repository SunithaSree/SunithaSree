          Version control (or source control or revision control) serves as a
          safety net to protect the source code from irreparable harm, giving
          the development team the freedom to experiment without fear of causing
          damage or creating code conflicts. If developers code concurrently and
          create incompatible changes, version control identifies the problem
          areas so that team members can quickly revert changes to a previous
          version, compare changes, or identify who committed the problem code
          through the revision history. With a version control system (VCS), a
          software team can solve an issue before progressing further into a
          project. Through code reviews, software teams can analyze earlier
          versions to understand the changes made to the code over time.
          Depending on a team's specific needs and development process, a VCS
          can be local, centralized, or distributed. A local VCS stores source
          files within a local system, a centralized VCS stores changes in a
          single server, and a distributed VCS involves cloning a Git
          repository.
