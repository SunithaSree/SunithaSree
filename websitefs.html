        It’s a really exciting time to be working on these technologies as we
        translate deep research and breakthroughs into products that truly help
        people. That’s the journey we’ve been on with large language models. Two
        years ago we unveiled next-generation language and conversation
        capabilities powered by our Language Model for Dialogue Applications (or
        LaMDA for short). We’ve been working on an experimental conversational
        AI service, powered by LaMDA, that we’re calling Bard. And today, we’re
        taking another step forward by opening it up to trusted testers ahead of
        making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks. Bard
        seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power,
        intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on
        information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard
        can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity, helping
        you to explain new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to
        a 9-year-old, or learn more about the best strikers in football right
        now, and then get drills to build your skills.
